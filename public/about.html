    <p id="face1Data"><b>MEOWTH! THAT'S RIGHT!</b><br><br>Hailing from Windsor, Ontario Canada, Adam enjoys sitting quietly and/or staring out the window at nothing in particular. On a list of hobbies he would have: Hiking, camping, video games, and going to the movies. Of 3 siblings, Adam is his mother’s favorite — he knows. During the creation of this project, Adam voted himself the fourth Most Valuable Contributor behind only Lola, Philip and Brandon. Adam’s future plans include finishing 301; heading onto and the completion of 401; then while conducting his job search, win the lottery and retire to his estate where he will sit quietly and stare out the window for the rest of his days. He’s also super single. Long walks. Beaches. Candle light.</p>

    <p id="face2Data"><b>MAKE IT DOUBLE!</b><br><br>Hello! My name is Duane Rush and thank you for visiting our site. I am a former biologist gone software developer. I was born in Tacoma and raised in Gig Harbor until the end of second grade. Then my family moved to the Palm Springs area of California until we moved back to Washington after I was out of High School. I obtained my bachelors degree in Cell Biology from Central Washington University and after graduating worked a job that showed me that this was not the path I wanted my life to take. So now here I am at code fellows! Some other cool facts about me would be that I love animals, video games, most things nerdy as well as being on the water as much as possible.</p>

    <p id="face3Data"><b>PREPARE FOR TROUBLE!</b><br><br>My name is Joseph Kim. I recently graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in mathematics. During my time at UW, I had the opportunity to take the introductory Java courses and have been intrigued by computer science ever since. After graduation, I worked briefly in IT and my plan now is to take the 401 Python class, get a job, and eventually return to school to get a proper computer science degree.</p>
